## Migration Notes

### From 1.x to 2.0

**Breaking Changes:**

- Complete architecture change from shell scripts to Ansible
- Configuration file format changes
- Installation command changes

**Migration Path:**

1. Backup existing configurations
2. Fresh installation recommended
3. Migrate custom settings to new operator format
4. Use new `./setup` command instead of old scripts

**Benefits:**

- More reliable and idempotent installations
- Better error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Easier customization through operators
