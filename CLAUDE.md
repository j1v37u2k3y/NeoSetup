# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

NeoSetup is a Matrix-themed development environment automation system built entirely with Ansible. It uses an innovative
operator-based configuration system to provide different levels of customization from minimal to power-user setups.

**Current Status: Phase 8 Complete** - Production-ready system with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, container testing
infrastructure, operator validation, multi-OS testing, and complete documentation suite.

## Common Commands

### Installation Commands

```bash
cd neosetup

# Full installation with jiveturkey operator
make install OPERATOR=jiveturkey

# Install specific components
make shell        # Shell configuration only
make tmux         # Tmux configuration only
make tools        # CLI tools only
make docker       # Docker only

# Dry run to preview changes
make dry-run OPERATOR=matrix

# Clean Ansible cache
make clean
```

### Testing & Validation Commands

```bash
# Operator validation
python3 scripts/validate_operator.py --all           # Validate all operators
python3 scripts/validate_operator.py base            # Validate specific operator
python3 scripts/validate_operator.py --info          # Show detailed validation info

# Comprehensive testing
python3 tests/test_operator_validation.py            # Run validation test suite
make lint                                           # Run ansible-lint
make test                                           # Run all tests

# Container testing (matches CI/CD)
.github/scripts/test_container.py --os ubuntu --operator jiveturkey

# Operator creation
python3 scripts/create_operator.py --interactive     # Interactive operator creation
python3 scripts/create_operator.py --list-templates  # List available templates
python3 scripts/create_operator.py --list-parents    # List parent operators

# Debugging & verbose output
make install OPERATOR=jiveturkey VERBOSE=true
```

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Operators

- Operators are defined in `neosetup/operators/*/vars.yml`
- Each operator can extend another using `extends: parent_operator`
- Variables are inherited and can be overridden

### Adding New Features

1. Create a new role in `neosetup/roles/`
2. Add tasks, templates, and handlers as needed
3. Include the role in `playbooks/site.yml`
4. Test with `make dry-run`

### Testing Changes

```bash
# Always test with dry-run first
make dry-run OPERATOR=jiveturkey

# Test individual roles
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml --tags "shell" --check

# Use verbose mode for debugging
make install OPERATOR=base VERBOSE=true
```

### 🚀 Next Phase: Advanced Features (Phase 9)

See `TODO.md` for Phase 9+ roadmap including multi-platform support, cloud integrations,
and language-specific operators.

## Important Notes

### File Locations

- **Documentation**: Complete documentation suite with installation, configuration, troubleshooting guides
- **Contributing**: Full contributing guide with development standards and workflows
- **Legal**: MIT License and comprehensive changelog
- **Operators**: Configuration in `neosetup/operators/` with full validation
- **Roles**: Ansible roles in `neosetup/roles/` with shared templates

### Best Practices

- Always use `make` commands for consistency
- Test changes with `--check` or `make dry-run`
- Follow Ansible best practices for roles and playbooks
- Maintain the Matrix theme in all output

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Permission errors**: Some tasks need sudo, use `--ask-become-pass`
- **Shell not changing**: Source the config or restart terminal
- **Tools not found**: Check if package names differ on your OS

## Development Tracking

- Use `TODO.md` for tracking major features and roadmap
- GitHub Issues for specific bugs and enhancements
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventional commits
- Document significant changes in git commit messages
- remember I only push code.
